# G4G Midterm Project

## Description

This project implements a simple maze game using OpenGL, in which users can control the camera and character to move inside the maze, but they cannot move through the wall. Maze is generated by randomized Prim's algorithm. There're 5 different character models and 5 different block textures loaded that will be randomly bound in the game. The background is implemented with skybox mapping and there're two light sources in this game. One is sunlight and another is the spotlight. Both light sources can produce shadows. To save resources, only blocks within 10 blocks of distance from the character will be rendered. Furthermore, the user can interact with the scene by placing or destroying blocks within 5 blocks.

## Getting Started

### Development Environment

* macOS Monterey 12.3.1 (apple-darwin21.4.0)
* clang-1316.0.21.2.5

### Dependencies

* assimp
* GLFW
* glad
* glm
* KHR
* stb_image.h

### Building the Program

* Using CMake to build this repository
```
cmake CMakeLists.txt 
cmake --build .
```
* Compiled executable file "Project" will be generated into build folder.

## Game Control
### Movement
* <kbd>w</kbd> for moving forward
* <kbd>s</kbd> for moving backward
* <kbd>a</kbd> for moving leftward
* <kbd>d</kbd> for moving rightward
* <kbd>q</kbd>/<kbd>e</kbd> for rotating camera
* <kbd>Mouse</kbd> for rotating camera
* <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> for zooming camera
### Game Action
* <kbd>Right Click</kbd> for placing block
* <kbd>Left Click</kbd> for detroying block
* <kbd>f</kbd> for turn on/off spotlight
* <kbd>r</kbd> for resetting random maze and character model
* <kbd>x</kbd> for changing perspective
* <kbd>esc</kbd> for quitting program
